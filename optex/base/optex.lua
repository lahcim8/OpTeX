-- Handling of color using attributes
--
-- Setting of color in PDF is handled by graphics operators which change the
-- graphics context. Colors for fills/strokes are distinguished, but apart from
-- that, only one color is active at time and is used for all material drawn by
-- following graphics operators, until next color is set. Each PDF content (e.g.
-- page or form XObject) has its own graphics context, that is initialized from
-- zero. Hence natural way of working with color (color settings are not lost
-- by going between pages) have to be handled.
--
-- \TeX/ itself has no concept of color. Color has always been handled by
-- inserting whatsits (either using `\special` for DVI or using
-- `\pdfliteral`/`\pdfcolorstack` for PDF). It is very efficient way of doing
-- it, \TeX/ doesn't have to know anything about colors, it just inserts the
-- relevant literals when doing `\shipout`. However, it is also problematic in
-- many ways:
--
-- \begitems
-- * Due to the asynchronic nature of shipping out pages, the handling of
-- initial color of page (which should be the last color of previous page) is
-- problematic.
-- * In \TeX/ there isn't only contiguous page content, but also headlines,
-- footlines and inserts (including footnotes). They shouldn't just take color
-- from what just happens to be preceding, but should be colored independently.
-- * Whatsit nodes are not really fully transparent to all stages of \TeX/ and
-- just turning on/off color can result in differently typeset documents. See
-- e.g.
--  \begitems
--   * \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/599165/why-does-color-change-vertical-alignement-in-table-with-fixed-width/}
--   * \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/599367/strange-vertical-spacing-after-colored-equation/}
--  \enditems
-- * To give a false notion of grouping with whatsits, implementations usually
-- set color and try to restore it with `\aftergroup`, which has its own quirks,
-- e.g:
--\begtt
--\setbox0=\hbox{\Red text}   % bad:  \Black is done after `\setbox`
--\setbox0=\hbox{{\Red text}} % good: \Black is done after group inside the box
--\endtt
-- \enditems
--
-- While the first two issues can be handled using `\pdfcolorstack`, the color
-- handling is still not really natural.
--
-- With \LuaTeX/ different approach is possible. We can set attributes, which
-- are bound to essentially everything \TeX/ creates (characters, rules, glues,
-- \dots) and respect grouping. Their behaviour is similar to that of font
-- setting on characters. In \TeX, every typeset character is internally a
-- char node that carries a font number with itself. This associated font number
-- stays the same and doesn't change on even on boxing/unboxing.
--
-- We can do the same with colors. It is a somewhat radical change, because some
-- coloring idioms may not work like before. But with a different mindset it
-- indeed seems more natural. If we create a box with text in default (black)
-- color, why should it change just because something before it says `\Yellow`?
-- If a footnote is created with color red it should be red regardless on what
-- pages it is typeset at (and what they contain).
--
-- Because \LuaTeX/ doesn't do anything with attributes, we have to add meaning
-- to them. We do this by intercepting \TeX/ just before it ships out a page and
-- inject PDF literals according to attributes.

-- The numbers used with this attribute are mapped to their corresponding PDF

-- attributes of “content” nodes matter, these include most importantly glyph
-- nodes and rule nodes which are colored directly, but also PDF literals and
-- similar, which also participate in coloring.
--
-- Whatsit node with color setting PDF literal is injected only when a
-- different color is needed, hence there shouldn't be any unnecessary
-- consecutive color changes which can happen with use of pdfTeX's color stack.
-- Our injection does not care about boxing levels, but this isn't a problem,
-- since (when placed correctly), PDF literal whatsits just instruct the
-- `\shipout` related procedures to emit the literal now.
--
-- Leaders (represented by glue nodes with leader field) are not handled fully.
-- They are problematic, because their content is repeated more times and it
-- would have to be ensured that the coloring would be right even for e.g.
-- leaders that start and end on a different color. I came to conclusion that
-- this is not worth, hence leaders are handled just opaquely and only the
-- attribute of the glue node itself is checked. For setting different colors
-- inside leaders, raw PDF literals have to be used.
--
-- We use the `node.direct` way of working with nodes. This is less safe, and
-- certainly not idiomatic Lua, but faster and codewise more close to the way
-- \TeX/ works with nodes.

-- content). Redefining the said primitive is not sufficient, because of
-- `\immediate`. Those that want to colorize boxes before transforming them to
-- xforms should use \`\_colorizebox``<boxnum>`.
